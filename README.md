## Questions and Answers (FAQ)

* ### **What is Blended Games (bGames)?**

    Blended Games is an open source project/framework developed by the InTeractiOn Lab at the University of Santiago de Chile. Its goal is to promote the development of video games that facilitate a balance between day to day tasks and virtual life, in order to prevent harmful situations for players, such as video game addiction.

* ### **How does bGames work?**

    bGames works through a series of services that measure and store a player's activity in a cloud profile. The points that constitute these profiles come from activities tracked by software and hardware. This could include, for example, a player's statistics on Chess.com or their mobile phone time use. These points are then categorized into various dimensions and attributes, which can be exchanged for advantages in video games.
